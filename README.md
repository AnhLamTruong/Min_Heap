# Min_Heap
Describtion of Min_Heap

Get Max or Min Element

The Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
Remove Max or Min Element

The time complexity of this operation is O(Log n) because we need to maintain the max/mix at their root node, which takes Log n operations.
Insert an Element

Time Complexity of this operation is O(Log n) because we insert the value at the end of the tree and traverse up to remove violated property of min/max heap.
